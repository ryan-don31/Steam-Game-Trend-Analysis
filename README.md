Steam can be seen as a comprehensive database of nearly every modern game created in recent history. In this notebook, the trends found through games released to steam over the past ~24 years will be analyzed, in hopes to see possible evidence of how game standards and practices have changed.</br>
The [datafile](#datafile) we will be using contains information of every game released to steam, ie. genre, price, number of recommendations, etc.</br>
This file will be used to find trends between game genres, the release dates, review scored given by <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/">Metacritic</a>, and game prices. Some general questions 
that will hopefully be answered are; how have the review scores of games changed over the years? How have the prices of games changed? What does the average price look like for each genre?</br>
The implications of findings will then be discussed, inferring possible explanations for the trends found.
